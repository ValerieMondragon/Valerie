# Table Label: Planet Name
# Database Column Name: pl_name
# NASA Description: The official name of the exoplanet.
# My explanation: literally just the planet’s name (Kepler-22 b type stuff).

# Table Label: Host Name
# Database Column Name: hostname
# NASA Description: The name of the star the planet orbits.
# My explanation: the parent star of the planet.

# Table Label: Discovery Method
# Database Column Name: discoverymethod
# NASA Description: The technique used to detect the planet 
# (transit, radial velocity, direct imaging, etc).
# My explanation: how we found the planet in the first place.

# Table Label: Spectral Type
# Database Column Name: st_spectype
# NASA Description: The spectral class of the host star 
# (like G2V for a Sun-like star, M-type for cool red star, etc).
# My explanation: tells you what kind of star it is, and kinda the vibe (hot, cool, sun-like, etc).

# Table Label: Equilibrium Temperature [K]
# Database Column Name: pl_eqt
# NASA Description: Estimated planetary temperature in Kelvin assuming no atmosphere.
# My explanation: sorta the “expected” temperature the planet should have.

# Table Label: Planet Mass or Mass*sin(i) [Jupiter Mass]
# Database Column Name: pl_bmassj
# NASA Description: Planet mass expressed in Jupiter masses (or minimum mass).
# My explanation: how big the planet is compared to Jupiter. Values >1 = huge planet.

#4.5 Checking my answers: 
#Title of paper: A temperate super-Jupiter imaged with JWST in the mid-infrared
#The abstract says JWST directly imaged a super-Jupiter that is surprisingly cool, around 275 K, which is close to room temperature. The planet is bright in mid-infrared images but does not appear at shorter wavelengths, suggesting its atmosphere is unusual or more opaque than expected. Its temperature matches what models predict for how giant planets cool over time, which helps confirm those theories. The authors also conclude that this is the only large planet in the system, clearing up earlier confusion. Overall, the study shows JWST can detect cooler giant planets, not just the very hot ones.
